Create two library modules and one App module

1. In the first library module have it return a random
catchphase, and generate a lucky number

2. In the second library module create a cartoon character
constructor function. Make one of the properties a catchpharse
that you will import from the generator module, and another a lucky
number.

3. In your app module, consume the cartoon module, create at least 
1 cartoon character instance, and print out its properties
